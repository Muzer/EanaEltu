Need a dispenser here! Need a teleporter here! Need a sentry here! Need a sourcecode here! Need a readme here!

Buildin' a readme.

NOTES
I'm really going OpenSource because I hope that somebody will improve it (by sending patches to me). I won't release the whole database. I won't allow direct access to the server. So, you can fork it and send me patches (which I will apply, as long as they are working). The code has grown over time; while it is more or less tidy coded, some parts may are useless or complicated to understand. I'm sorry for that. I never imagined that this would go *this* far.

REQUIREMENTS
- Perl + knowledge of it
- Apache 2
- MySQL 5
- mwForum 2.22 (not really necessary, unless for TSV/CSV/SQL creation)
- UNIX (or something that understands UNIX sockets)
- git, obviously
- Speaking German and knowing internet memes can help understanding some of the comments

INSTALLATION
1.) Rename EEConfigDefault.pm to EEConfig.pm and fill in all necessary fields.
2.) Rename .keysdefault to .keys and insert a few real keys. I'd recommend hashes of something, doesn't matter.
3.) Insert data.sql into the database.
4.) ???
5.) Profit.
