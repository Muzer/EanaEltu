Buildin' a readme.

Things you should get if you really want to get into the developement:
- Perl + knowledge of it
- Apache 2
- MySQL 5
- mwForum 2.22 (not really necessary, unless for TSV/CSV/SQL creation)
- UNIX (or something that understands UNIX sockets)
- git, obviously
- Speaking German and knowing internet memes can help understanding some of the comments
